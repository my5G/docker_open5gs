# docker_open5gs
Docker files to build and run open5gs in a docker

## Tested Setup

Docker host machine

- Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04

SDRs tested with srsLTE eNB

- Ettus USRP B210
- LimeSDR Mini v1.3

UERANSIM (gNB + UE) simulator

## Build and Execution Instructions

* Mandatory requirements:
	* [docker-ce](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu)
	* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose)


Clone repository and build base docker image of open5gs, kamailio, ueransim

```
git clone https://github.com/herlesupreeth/docker_open5gs
cd docker_open5gs/base
git checkout 4g_plus
docker build --no-cache --force-rm -t docker_open5gs .

cd ../ims_base
docker build --no-cache --force-rm -t docker_kamailio .
```

### Build and Run using docker-compose

```
cd ..
set -a
source .env
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up

# srsLTE eNB
docker-compose -f srsenb.yaml build --no-cache
docker-compose -f srsenb.yaml up -d && docker attach srsenb
```

## Configuration

For the quick run (eNB/gNB, CN in same docker network), edit only the following parameters in .env as per your setup

```
MCC
MNC
TEST_NETWORK --> Change this only if it clashes with the internal network at your home/office
DOCKER_HOST_IP --> This is the IP address of the host running your docker setup
SGWU_ADVERTISE_IP --> Change this to value of DOCKER_HOST_IP set above only if eNB/gNB is not running the same docker network/host
```

If eNB/gNB is NOT running in the same docker network/host as the host running the dockerized Core/IMS then follow the below additional steps

Under mme section in docker compose file (docker-compose.yaml), uncomment the following part
```
...
    # ports:
    #   - "36412:36412/sctp"
...
```

Uncomment the following part under sgwu section
```
...
    # ports:
    #   - "2152:2152/udp"
...
```

## Register a UE information

Open (http://<DOCKER_HOST_IP>:3000) in a web browser, where <DOCKER_HOST_IP> is the IP of the machine/VM running the open5gs containers. Login with following credentials
```
Username : admin
Password : 1423
```

Using Web UI, add a subscriber

## srsLTE eNB settings

If SGWU_ADVERTISE_IP is properly set to the host running the SGWU container, then the following static route is not required.
On the eNB, make sure to have the static route to SGWU container (since internal IP of the SGWU container is advertised in S1AP messages and UE wont find the core in Uplink)

```
ip r add <SGWU_CONTAINER_IP> via <SGWU_ADVERTISE_IP>
```

## Not supported
- IPv6 usage in Docker
